Where you are asked to provide descriptive text and answer questions, please do so via well formatted Markdown cells below the problem. You are strongly encouraged to use both `Numpy` and `Matplotlib` documentation in developing your plots. Use of LLMs is accepted, but verify LLM-supplied code by consulting the documentation.\n",

    "As part of your thesis, you are examining the potential influence of forest fires in the Upper Boise River Basin (UBRB) on hydrologic processes including snow accumulation/melt, soil moisture, and streamflow. You decide to start out by examining streamflow and want to get a sense of how much streamflow varies across two years, separated by 30 years. As such, you decide to examine streamflow from Water Years 1987 and 2017 (although you know the latter is a large snow year). __Instructions:__ Run the code cell below, altering only which gage you will use (choose 0-3, corresponding to the commented descriptions of the gages)."

    "Although you are towards the beginning of your research, you do need to demonstrate research progress. Your advisor has encouraged you to prepare a PowerPoint presentation the Pacific Northwest Water Summit in early November, and prepare some figures appropriate for a thesis proposal in the spring. As such, you need to efficiently create identical figures that are appropriate to both presentation and print formats. A manageable task that you can do by November is to plot both the empirical frequency distribution function (the histogram in frequency space) of the two years of streamflow data, as well as the associated cumulative density function (CDF). Your advisor agrees this is reasonable, but also wants you to highlight the mean of each year on the frequency distribution and the median flow, 5% non-exceedance, and 95% non-exceedance flows on the CDF. With this established you need a plan. __Your completed notebook should show 4 plots.__\n",

In class, we talked a bit about \"defensive coding.\" Looking at the function above, identify 3 different errors a user (you) might make in calling that function and how you might use some defensive programming strategies to protect against those errors.\n"
