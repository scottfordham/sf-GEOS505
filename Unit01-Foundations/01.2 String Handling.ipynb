    "### Understanding Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "An important, but these days often overlooked, aspect of learning a new scientific programming language is how that languages treat different data types. A data type is an attribute that specifies values that a variable can take and ultimately the operations that can be performed on that variable. Generally speaking, data types include integers, floating point numbers, and character strings. In Python, we declare a variable simply using a statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = 24`\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement effectively instructs Python to create a variable we will refer to as `x` equal to a numerical value of 24. Note that we haven't specified it's data type. This contrasts to languages like C, in which we would define a variable using something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`int x = 24;`\n",
    "\n",
    "So, then how does Python figure out what the data type is? Let's explore:"

    "__Example 1__: I have written a code that computes evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith equation. One function (more on this later) in this code takes the air temperature (in °C) and the relative humidity (in %) as input and returns the vapor pressure deficit (VPD). My code keeps returning unrealistic numbers (evapotranspiration values of 3 **meters** per day) and I suspect that there might be an issue with the way that VPD is calculated. To debug my code, I would like to print out the values of air temperature and relative humidity that the function is receiving, and the value of VPD it is returning as output. I can basically identify three potential outcomes of this debugging test:\n",
