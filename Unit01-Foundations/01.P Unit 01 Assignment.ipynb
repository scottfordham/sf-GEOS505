    "### 1. Problem Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new graduate student, your research is examining the performance of 5-day precipitation forecasts at a number of Snotel sites in the Upper Boise River Basin. The forecasts are generated by a research center at a university in the western United States using the [Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) model. They run a 360 hr (i.e., 15 day) forecast using WRF every day at the top of every hour for the entire western United States, and puts the output you need on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket that is freely available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "File pattern:\n",
    "WRF_fcst_YYYYMMDD_HHz_VVV.nc\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- YYYY is the year of the forecast date\n",
    "- MM is the month of the forecast date\n",
    "- DD is the day of the forecast\n",
    "- HH is the hour the forecast was initiated (0-23)\n",
    "- VVV is the valid hour of the forecast from the time of initiation in hours (0-360 hr in 3 hr increments). So 000 is the initial hour of the forecast, 003 would be the 3rd hour, 006 the 6th, and so forth.\n",
    "- 'WRF_fcst_' is the prefix of the file name\n",
    "- '.nc' is the file extension (this stands for NetCDF file - a real file format)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes as input the forecast year, month, day, and hour, as well as a maximum valid hour and returns a list of file names that contain the forecast data\n",
    "2. Test your code for three days (2025-03-01, 2025-04-01, and 2025-05-01), for forecast hour 6, and a maximum valid hour of 120 hours. Print the results of the returned list to the screen and verify manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Concepts Assessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String handling\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "- Basic functions"

    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You just started grad school and inhereted some code from the final chapter of a previous student's thesis. That last chapter was completed in about 1 month and your advisor has said they want you to follow up on the precipitation analysis the student has done with a new version of the precipitation dataset that was just released. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you dig through their code to make it work, you realize it's not commented well at all. Additionally, the student is now working Goldman Sachs working on CliFi (climate finance) problems and, well, you can't afford their hourly rate to get some help! In order to get the data, you would need to modify the name of the files, because the revised dataset uses a different naming convention. The previous student's code to create a list of the names of files to download and analyze is below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your own words, what does the code do? Is it correct? \n",
    "2. Go through the old student's code and add comments describing what the code is doing. Comments should be thorough enough that they're helpful for you, but also the student that comes after you. \n",
    "3. Are there some things in the code that you would do to edit the code for clarity (i.e., to make it more readible)? Make a list of these things, but do not implement them. \n",
