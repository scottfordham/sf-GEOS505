    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a common tool that we use to perform a repetitive task (e.g., operations, calculations, etc.). They are ubiquitous in all computing languages and elegantly demonstrate *why* we use computers... to, for instance, perform hundreds of thousands of repetitive tasks. There are fundamentally two kinds of loops: the `for` loop and the `while` loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand how these two loops differ and why you might use each. A `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you need to perform an operation. A `while` loop is used when you don't know how many times you need to perform an operation, but you do know when to stop. The syntax of these commands illustrates how they differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loop Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A kind of canonical case for the use of for loops (at least historically) is in computing moments. The first moment of a sequence of numbers ($x$) is the mean, and is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean and $N$ is the number of values of $x$ that we have. Qualitatively, the above equation says \"to compute the mean, compute the sum of all of the numbers in $x$ and divide by the number of $x$s, $N$. We would operationalize this as follows: "

Because of the random size of the steps, a random walk was sometimes historically known as a \"drunkard's walk.\" For a random walk process, we might want to know how many steps it takes to exceed a particular distance. As such, we know when the loop should terminate, but we don't know how many steps it takes. Let's say we're interested in how many steps it takes to excede 100 ft. This is what that would look like:"
