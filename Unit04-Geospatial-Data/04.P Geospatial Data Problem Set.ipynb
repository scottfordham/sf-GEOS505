    "\n",
    "__Background:__ For your graduate research, you are using lidar-derived snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates to assimilate into a physics based hydrology model to make streamflow predictions. In thinking through your hypotheses portions of the landscape where SWE data will have the most impact, you are reminded of a figure you saw in a presentation at a recent meeting. The figure shows how the distribution of SWE and land area across a range of elevation interact to control the distribution of water storage in the landscape. The figure looked like the following:\n",

    "<img src='../img/aso_swe.png' alt='Upper Colorado ASO Analysis' width='750' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You already have grids of estimated SWE from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) for 4 separate dates at a 50 m spatial resolution, and a coregistered digital elevation model of the study area – the East River in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Task:__ Use the skills you've developed and the example notebooks you've examined in this module to create an image like the above. The ASO and coregistered DEM can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SkjOWPPJe5N25arCW6qbf2ZJWQsrUAAp). Use any of the four ASO files, which corresponds to 2 different dates in 2018 or 2019, or write your code generically to plot any or all dates. You should only need `rasterio`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to create this figure.    "
